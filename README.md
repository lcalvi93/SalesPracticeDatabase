This is a free, publicly accessible small database that people can use to play around and query data. 
This is a Microsoft SQL Database. 

The credentials for sql server authentication are:
  username: test   password: test 
  
Alongside the database is a python program that can be used to insert data into the sales tables. 
You just need to adjust the database connection settings - the self.server line should be changed to the IP address of your computer where the database is in SSMS. 

The database already has some sample stored procedures and views which can be modified. 
  These are also saved in their respective folders within this repository. 

Enjoy :)
